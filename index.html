            <p>It is a simple voting system made using C language. This is my first project built by me in my B-Tech 1st
                year.<br>
                How it works is that it contains all the roll numbers of student and when the student enters his roll
                number it will validate the roll number and then the program will ask the student to select the
                candidate to vote for. After the student selects the candidate the program will increment the vote count
                of the candidate and then the program will display the candidate who got the highest votes.<br>
                One student can vote only once and the student can't vote for himself. <br>
                This project is made to understand the basics of C language and to understand the concepts of arrays and
                loops.

                How it works is that it contains all the tasks and their priorities. The program will display the tasks
                and their priorities and the user can add a new task and the program will add the task to the list of
                tasks and the user can delete the task and the program will delete the task from the list of tasks. <br>
                This project is made to understand the concepts of data structures and to understand the concepts of
