            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <li>C</li>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>It is a simple voting system made using C language. This is my first project built by me in my B-Tech 1st year.<br>
                How it works is that it contains all the roll numbers of student and when the student enters his roll number it will validate the roll number and then the program will ask the student to select the candidate to vote for. After the student selects the candidate the program will increment the vote count of the candidate and then the program will display the candidate who got the highest votes.<br>
                One student can vote only once and the student can't vote for himself. <br>
                This project is made to understand the basics of C language and to understand the concepts of arrays and loops.
